1. To run code for Linear Regression (Housing, Yacht, Concrete Datasets):
	a. Open the terminal
	b. Switch directories to this folder
	c. Run the command -->
        For Housing dataset: python3 LinearRegression.py Housing
        For Yacht dataset: python3 LinearRegression.py Yacht
        For Concrete dataset: python3 LinearRegression.py Concrete
    d. Results will be printed to the console, plotted two graphs will show in pop-up windows.
    * This include both gradient descent and normal equation results.

2. To run code for Polynomial Regression (Sinusoid, Yacht Datasets):
    a. Open the terminal
	b. Switch directories to this folder
	c. Run the command --> 
        For Sinusoid dataset: python3 PolynomialRegression-Sinusoid.py
        For Yacht dataset: python3 PolynomialRegression-Yacht.py
    d. Results will be printed to the console, plotted graphs will show in pop-up windows.

3. To run code for Ridge Regression (Sinusoid Dataset):
    a. Open the terminal
	b. Switch directories to this folder
	c. Run the command --> 
        For power = 5: python3 RidgeRegression.py 5
        For power = 9: python3 RidgeRegression.py 9
    d. Results will be printed to the console, plotted graphs will show in seperate pop-up windows.
